-------------------
A binary tree is represented in the following language:
1. If the node is a leaf node it is represented as it's value
2. If it is not a leaf node it is represented as {value,left,right}
3. If any of the child is not present, it is represented as 0

NOTE: The value of each node will be a positive single digit integer. 0 represents that there is no left/right node.

    1
   / \
  2   3
 /     \ 
4       5

4 will be represented as - 4
5 will be represented as - 5
2 will be represented as - {2,4,0}
3 will be represented as - {3,0,5}
Assuming that 4 and 5 don't exist node 1 will be represented as {1,2,3}

The whole tree will be represented as {1,{2,4,0},{3,0,5}}

Given a string in this language, you need to print the inorder traversal of this tree. The output of the above tree will be
4,2,1,3,5


For the given string: {1,{2,4,5},{3,0,6}}, the output will be 4,2,5,1,3,6
Following is the tree representation for this example
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \   \    
4   5   6


Input: 
2
{1,{2,4,0},{3,0,5}}
{1,{2,4,5},{3,0,6}}

Output
4,2,1,3,5
4,2,5,1,3,6

2. Finding dictionary rank of a combination of letters. 
Given an array of unique letters as input and a word consisting of all those letters. 
You need to find the rank of the given word if all its permutation are placed in a dictionary.

The output of your function should be the position of the word whose rank you need to output. 

Hence, your function / input could be the following: 

function ( ['c', 'a', 'r'], 'arc')

Output would be position of 'arc' in the following --- in this case, 2. 

(without using a permutation library)

acr 
arc
car
cra
rac
rca

The input file consists of number of letters (n) followed by n letters and a word consisting of those letters

Input
3
a
r
c
arc

Output
2
